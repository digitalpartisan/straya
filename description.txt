'Straya! is a joke mod that has a chance of triggering a Drop Bear attack.  This chance is calculated at a regular interval.  Both the interval time and the spawn chance can be altered with the included holotape.

By default, the spawn chance is 10% and the spawning interval is once every twenty-four in-game hours.  The included holotape, named "[Settings] 'Straya!" for VIS compatibility, allows changing the roll frequency and spawn chance.  You could, if you wanted, set 'Straya! to have a 100% chance to spawn a Drop Bear every in-game hour.  The holotape also gives you the option of safely uninstalling 'Straya!

While not at all hard to kill (since 'Straya! is intended to be a mild inconvenience rather than a serious threat.  Even so, Drop Bears are somewhat leveled and they will hit relatively hard until they are dealt with.
